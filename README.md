# SC1015 Mini Project: Predicting Telco Customer Churn


## About 
This is a Mini-Project for the SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) module in Nanyang Technological University (NTU).

Our group aims to utilise customer data from Telcos to analyse the factors that affect churn.


## Problem Definition 

In the highly competitive telecommunications industry, customer churn is a critical challenge for telecomunication companies (Telco). Customer churn (or customer attrition) refers to the loss of customers due to dissatisfaction of the services provided and/or due to better offers 
from other companies. 

Churn results in a loss of revenue of the company and it has become increasingly difficult to retain customers today.

Telco businesses are thus seeking to develop models to predict which customers are more likely to leave soon and take actions accordingly.



## Models/ Libraries used
-Classification Tree
-Random Forest
-Logistic Regression
-XGBoost
-LightGBM

## Data Preparation

Dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mnassrib/telecom-churn-datasets
Our dataset does not contain missing values. 
However, we did notice that there was an inbalance in classes of the churn data. 
Hence, we use SMOTE.
OneHotEncoding & change bool/ categorical data to int64


## Machine Learning
